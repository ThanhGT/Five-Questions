# Five-Questions
A web application listing five questions and keeps track of your total score

This web application asks the user five questions and for each question answered correctly, grants the user one point up to a total of 5 points. Each question answered incorrectly will grant the user zero points. You can attempt the five questions by hitting 'attempt'. You will be prompted for an answer, for the question that has a true/false. Ok means TRUE and cancel means FALSE. As you answer the questions, your total will be tallied up at the bottom of the page.
